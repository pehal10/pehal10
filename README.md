## Hi I'm Pehal ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a student at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), pursuing a BS in Computer Science. Iâ€™m passionate about full-stack development and the transformative impact of AI/ML in solving meaningful challenges. Currently, as a fellow with Breakthrough Tech AI (Cornell Tech), I had the opportunity to develop skills in training models and data analysis. My team and I worked on a project with Relativity to identify biases in frontier large language models, with a particular focus on potential harms it may cause in legal decisions affecting society. This experience deepened my ML and technical expertise while strengthening my commitment to creating effective, data-centric solutions.

âœ¨ Fun fact: I'm currently serving as the Public Relations Chair for the Society of Women Engineers at UTD which has allowed me to find a supportive community and lead impactful initiatives in outreach and professional development.
